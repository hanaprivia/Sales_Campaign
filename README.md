# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using various data science techniques, including **K-Means Clustering**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, and **Auto-Encoders**. By clustering customers based on their behaviors and features, the project aims to help businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and promote sales effectively.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into three main sections, each of which contributes to customer segmentation in a unique way:
1. **K-Means Clustering**: A straightforward clustering technique that groups customers based on their similarity.
2. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: A dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify the dataset, retaining essential patterns while reducing complexity.
3. **Auto-Encoders**: A neural network-based method to create compact representations of customers, enabling deeper insights and efficient clustering.

## Sections

### K-Means Clustering
The **K-Means Clustering** section focuses on segmenting customers into groups based on their behaviors and features. K-Means is a popular algorithm for clustering due to its simplicity and efficiency. 

- **Objective**: To identify distinct customer groups with similar attributes.
- **Method**: We calculate the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**. The K-Means algorithm then assigns each customer to the nearest cluster center.
- **Output**: Each customer is assigned a cluster label, helping us to profile different segments based on their cluster characteristics.

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
The **PCA** section reduces the dimensionality of the dataset, helping to simplify the clustering process while retaining the most important information.

- **Objective**: To reduce the number of features and visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.
- **Method**: We apply PCA to transform the dataset, reducing it to a lower number of principal components that capture the maximum variance.
- **Application in Clustering**: After applying PCA, the transformed dataset can be used for more efficient clustering. This also aids in visualization, allowing us to observe the separation between clusters.

### Auto-Encoders
The **Auto-Encoders** section leverages neural networks to encode customers into a compact, lower-dimensional space.

- **Objective**: To create a compressed representation of each customerâ€™s data, capturing essential patterns while discarding noise.
- **Method**: We use an autoencoder model with an encoder and decoder structure. The encoder compresses the input data into a smaller representation, and the decoder attempts to reconstruct the original data from this compressed form.
- **Application in Clustering**: The encoded (compressed) data is used for clustering. By using autoencoders, we can capture complex patterns in customer data, which may not be easily detected with traditional clustering methods.

## Results
Each technique provides unique insights into customer segmentation:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Generates distinct, interpretable customer groups based on distance metrics.
- **PCA**: Reduces noise and helps with visualizing high-dimensional data, making it easier to see the separation between clusters.
- **Auto-Encoders**: Captures complex, non-linear relationships, enabling the detection of subtler customer segments.
